#L'eredità
Hacking a popular italian TV show using corpus linguistics.

IBM's Watson has already made the news in winning the Jeopardy TV show. Watson is the synthesis of years of research in artificial intelligence, information extraction and natural language processing. It required huge amounts of money. At present time IBM is offering Watson's performances as a service: check it here[AGGIUNGI LINK].

"L'eredità" is a popular italian TV show: most of the quizzes are language and/or knowledge based. The final one, the quiz which leads players to the money, is entirely language based. We will try to use traditional corpus linguistic tool to win the game.

## The game
The rules are simple:
- the player will build a set of 5 words
- the building process is almost random
- the player has to write down a sixth  word linked to the other 5
- max 1 minute

Let me clarify the rules with an example.

## Framing the problem in language science's terms

## Implementation

### Corpus

### Queries
- requests
- html parsing
- pandas

### Computations
- mi scores
- dicts

### Results

## Inverting the problem
Or, hosting the game.

## Conclusions
