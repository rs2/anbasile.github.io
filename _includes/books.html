  <h3>Haskell Programming form First Principles</h3>
  <h4>C. Allen, J. Moronuki</h4>
  <p>
  Learning Haskell from the ground up is easier and works better - for both experienced hackers and people new to programming. The language is different enough from any you might've already tried that building up from the foundations will be less difficult and more enjoyable.

  <h3>The Secret Life of Pronouns</h3>
  <h4>J. Pennebaker</h4>
  <p>
    In The Secret Life of Pronouns, social psychologist and language expert James W. Pennebaker uses his groundbreaking research in computational linguistics-in essence, counting the frequency of words we use-to show that our language carries secrets about our feelings, our self-concept, and our social intelligence. Our most forgettable words, such as pronouns and prepositions, can be the most revealing: their patterns are as distinctive as fingerprints.
